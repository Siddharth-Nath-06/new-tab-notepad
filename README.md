# New Tab Notepad
Persistent New Tab Notepad is a minimalist, distraction-free note-taking extension that adds persistent notepad panels in your browser's new tab page.

Built for quick jotting, daily plans, or random thoughts — each note panel stays exactly where you left it, even after you close your browser. Add, move, delete, or theme your notes with ease.

> ⚠️ Currently only works in Brave and some other chromium-based browsers with an experimental flag enabled. &nbsp;**DOES NOT WORK IN GOOGLE CHROME.**

- 🎨 **Per-Note Themes** — Choose from 4 different themes for individual notes.
- 💾 **Persistent Data** — Notes are saved locally and persist across sessions.
- 🔒 **Privacy-First** — No internet access, no tracking, no sync — everything stays on your machine.
